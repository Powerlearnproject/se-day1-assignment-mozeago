#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.  
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to develop and maintain high-quality software. It is important because it enables the creation of systems that drive various aspects of life, such as manufacturing, finance, and the automobile industry.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. In the 1960s, software engineering was established as its own discipline.
2. In the 1970s, structured programming was introduced.
3. In the early 2000s, Agile methodology emerged as a key component of software engineering.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.  
1. Requirements Gathering: The team collects and documents the system's necessary features and user expectations as user requirements.
2. Design: Both the visual and architectural aspects of the software system are planned and developed.
3. Implementation: Developers use various tools to translate the requirements and designs into a functional system through coding.
4. Testing: The system undergoes unit testing, integration testing, system testing to ensure that it meets the users' needs.
5. Releasing: The software system is deployed for use by the intended users.
6. Maintenance: Developers provide ongoing support, updates, and improvements to the software system.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.  
The Waterfall methodology uses a top-down sequential approach to develop a software system, starting from requirements gathering through to release. In contrast, Agile relies on iteration and incremental development as its main strengths. Waterfall is ideal for systems with very clear and stable requirements that are not subject to change during development. On the other hand, Agile is ideal for systems where requirements are clear but may undergo many changes during the development process.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.  
1. Software Developer: The engineer who transforms requirements and design into a functional system using code.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer: Responsible for ensuring that the developed system is tested and meets quality standards through predefined test cases.
3. Project Manager: Responsible for overseeing and guiding the team through all stages of the SDLC until the software system is delivered or released for use.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.  
An IDE like Visual Studio Code helps a software developer code the requirements and designs provided by the project manager into a functional software system. A version control system like Git helps track changes in the source code and facilitates collaboration within a software development team.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.  
Tight deadlines can lead to rushed development, changing requirements during the process can create complications, and shortcuts in implementing features may lead to maintenance issues. Clear and effective communication, prioritizing tasks, regularly revisiting project goals and timelines, and robust use of Agile methodologies can help address these common challenges in the SDLC.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.  
1. Unit Testing: This process involves testing each modular unit of the software system individually. It confirms that each unit functions correctly and helps identify problems or bugs before the units are integrated.
2. Integration Testing: This testing phase focuses on verifying how well different modules and subsystems interact with each other.
3. System Testing: This involves testing the entire software system after combining all modules and units to ensure that all components work together and produce the intended outcome.
4.Acceptance Testing: This final phase checks whether the system meets the user requirements and functions as expected from the end user's perspective.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.  
Prompt Engineering is the process of providing AI tools with clear, correct, and concise questions to ensure they produce accurate and relevant answers. It helps the AI tool generate responses that are intended and correct.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.  
For example, asking 'What is a program?' is broad, whereas a more refined question like 'What is a software program?' specifies the context and narrows down the query. This helps the AI tool provide a more accurate and relevant response.
